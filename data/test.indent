    TEST COMPLETE
    Notes:
     It would be nice if I didnt have to indent the first array
     But I dont know how to build the rules for that
     Perhaps if I can emit START and EOF
     and create a special rule:
        array: START elements EOF
        array: INDENT elements DEDENT
    But no matter
